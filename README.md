# Ansible roles to deploy Springboot applications on Linux

Maintained and provided as a community contribution by [LHQG](https://www.lhqg.fr/).

## Table of Contents

4. [Limitations - OS compatibility, etc.](#limitations)

## Overview

These OS structures are:

* OS user and group,
* LVM LV and filesystems (optional),
* Directory trees
* systemd units
* packages

## springboot_foundation role

The `springboot_foundation` role prepares the OS to host one or multiple Springboot applications.

It creates structures such as user/group, LVM FS/LV, directories.
It ensures the SELinux and systemd packages for Springboot are installed.

### Directories

### Role variables

`sbf_user_id`: UID (default: 5000) for the `springboot` user which will run the Springboot process(es).
`sbf_group_id`: GID (default: 5000) for the `springboot` group.

`sbf_dedicated_lv_opt`: (_yes_|no) Whether the /opt/springboot directory tree should be created as a dedicated filesystem and logical volume,
`sbf_dedicated_vg_opt`: Name of the volume group to host the /opt/springboot filesystem.

`sbf_dedicated_lv_srv`: (_yes_|no) Whether the /srv/springboot directory tree should be created as a dedicated filesystem and logical volume,
`sbf_dedicated_vg_srv`: Name of the volume group to host the /srv/springboot filesystem.

`sbf_dedicated_lv_log`: (_yes_|no) Whether the /var/log/springboot directory tree should be created as a dedicated filesystem and logical volume,
`sbf_dedicated_vg_log`: Name of the volume group to host the /var/log/springboot filesystem.

`sbf_systemd_target_enabled`: (_yes_|no) Whether the `springboot.target` systemd unit should be enabled so that all Springboot applications are started at boot ime.

## springboot_instance role

The `springboot_instance` role deploys a specific Springboot application on the host.

See [springboot_instance role README](ansible-roles/ansible-role-springboot_instance/README.md)

## Limitations

Works only on Red Hat Linux and Red Hat like distributions.

## Development
